## Eduard Paul Enoiu, Senior Lecturer, PhD

I am a researcher and lecturer at Mälardalen University in Västerås, Sweden, primarily affiliated with the Software Testing Laboratory and the Formal Modelling and Analysis groups at the department of Networked and Embedded Systems. A native of Bucharest, I earned an Engineer's degree from Polytechnic University of Bucharest in 2009 and a PhD from Mälardalen University in 2016. 

My research interests span software engineering and empirical research, especially how to test, maintain, evolve and assure high-quality industrial software systems. I teach automated testing and model-based testing at the masters and PhD levels as well as to industrial practitioners. Currently I am doing research on a diverse array of topics in software development, including the role of automatic test generation (where tests are intelligently and algorithmically created) in industrial practice; the use of model checking for engineering better systems; the nature of creating efficient and effective tests; the cognitive aspects of software testing.

### Supervision

If you are interested in doing a bachelor or a master thesis at Mälardalen University, and if you are a good and ambitious student interested in software engineering, embedded system development and software testing, then have a look on some general topics listed below (these topics are not taken by any student). If you are interested in any of these please email me.

I advise bachelor and master’s theses in all areas that I actively conduct research in:

1. Software Testing, with a particular focus on test design and benchmarking of tests.

2. Embedded Systems, particularly the development of industrial control and safety-critical software.

3. Model Checking and Model-Based Testing, particularly the use of models (e.g., timed automata) for building better systems.

4. Human aspects of Software Engineering, particularly cognitive aspects of software development.

5. Engineering Digital Systems and Circuits, especially using Verilog and other HDL architectures, and particularly how they relate to testing.
